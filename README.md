## About Me

I am currently pursuing B.E. in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at Dr. D. Y. Patil Institute of Technology, Pune (CGPA: 8.94/10). My focus lies in developing intelligent systems using Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Data Science to solve real-world problems. I am passionate about exploring cutting-edge AI technologies and applying them to create impactful solutions.

## Technical Skills

**Programming Languages:** Python, C++, C, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS

**Data Science & Machine Learning:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, OpenCV, PyTorch, TensorFlow

**Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Power BI, Tableau

**Databases:** MySQL

**Tools & Frameworks:** Git/GitHub, Docker, Streamlit, Flask, Linux, Google Colab, Kaggle

**Web Technologies:** React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS

## Featured Projects

### Conclave AI - Multi-Model Debate System
Developed a system where multiple LLM chatbots (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) engage in structured debates on user-defined topics. The interactive GUI built with Python and Streamlit enables users to compare reasoning styles across different AI models and evaluate the most reliable outputs.

**Technologies:** Python, Streamlit, LLM APIs, Natural Language Processing

### Context-Aware PDF Document Intelligence System
Built an advanced PDF document intelligence system using LayoutLMv3 and PyTorch. The system extracts and analyzes document structure and content for automated information retrieval. Containerized with Docker for seamless deployment across different environments.

**Technologies:** LayoutLMv3, PyTorch, Docker, NLP

### Traffic Signal Optimizer
Designed and implemented a Reinforcement Learning-based traffic management system that optimizes signal timings using real-time vehicle density data. The system reduces average waiting times at intersections by dynamically adjusting signal timings based on live camera feeds processed through OpenCV.

**Technologies:** Reinforcement Learning, OpenCV, Python, Computer Vision
